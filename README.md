# LinkGrab

A tiny tool for grabbing all the links out of a Zoom chat transcript.

To use:

1. **VERY IMPORTANT**: Remember to download the chat transcript from a zoom call before the meeting ends.
2. Upload that transcript here (it's not being sent anywhere, just processed in your client)
3. Voila! Now you have a handy list of links you can copy/paste into your place of choice (e.g. to share with the other folks that were on that zoom call)
