# LinkGrab

A tiny tool for grabbing all the links out of a Zoom chat transcript.

To use:

1. (VERY IMPORTANT) Remember to download the chat transcript from zoom call before the meeting ends.
2. Upload that transcript here (it's not saved anywhere just processed in your client)
3. Voila, have a handy list of links you can copy/paste into your place of choice (e.g. to share with the other folks that were on that zoom call)
